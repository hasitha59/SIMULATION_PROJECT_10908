# 📘 Elevator Simulation in C

This project simulates the movement of an elevator between floors in a building.
The elevator responds to user requests, determines the correct direction (up or down), and moves one floor at a time until it reaches the target floor.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Simulates elevator movement between **Floor 0 to Floor 10**
* Displays direction: **UP** or **DOWN**
* Moves step-by-step, printing each floor reached
* Allows multiple floor requests
* Stops the simulation when user enters **-1**

---

## 📂 How It Works

1. Elevator starts at **Floor 0**.
2. User enters a floor number (0–10).
3. Elevator decides whether to move **up** or **down**.
4. Elevator moves one floor at a time, showing each step.
5. Continues accepting new requests until the user types **-1**.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Simulation of real-world systems using C
* Use of loops and conditional statements
* User-controlled process flow
* Understanding step-based execution logic

## 📘 Example Output

```
Current Elevator Position: Floor 0
Enter floor request (0 to 10) or -1 to stop: 5
Direction: UP
Elevator at floor: 1
Elevator at floor: 2
...
Elevator at floor: 5
Ding! Elevator reached Floor 5
```
